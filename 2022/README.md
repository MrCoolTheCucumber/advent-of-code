# Advent of Code 2022

My advent of code 2022 code. I started this quite late unfortunately (a few days before xmas), If I had started earlier I probably would have done it in kotlin

## Project structure

Each days two part challange is a crate in the cargo workspace. Each crates expects an `input.txt` file (which contains the input for the puzzle) in the root of the crates directory.
